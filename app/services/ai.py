════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING METHODOLOGY — READ CAREFULLY
════════════════════════════════════════
The final match percentage shown to the user is NOT a single gut-feel number.
It is calculated in Python as a weighted sum of FIVE dimension scores you provide:

  Final % = (skills_match × 0.35)
           + (experience_match × 0.25)
           + (domain_match × 0.20)
           + (qualifications_match × 0.10)
           + (soft_skills_match × 0.10)

Score each dimension 0-100 using ONLY the evidence present in the JD and resume:

  skills_match (35 %):
    100 = every required/preferred technical skill explicitly demonstrated
     75 = most core skills present, 1–2 minor gaps
     50 = roughly half the required skills present
     25 = few skills match; significant technology gaps
      0 = no meaningful skill overlap

  experience_match (25 %):
    100 = years of experience meets or exceeds JD requirement AND seniority matches
     75 = within 1–2 years of requirement OR seniority one level off
     50 = roughly half the required experience OR significant seniority gap
     25 = very early career vs senior role (or vice versa)
      0 = no relevant experience at all / no resume

  domain_match (20 %):
    100 = same industry, same problem space, direct domain expertise
     75 = adjacent domain with clear transferable knowledge
     50 = some domain overlap but meaningful gaps
     25 = different industry, limited transferability
      0 = completely unrelated domain

  qualifications_match (10 %):
    100 = all mandatory qualifications/certs met or exceeded
     75 = most qualifications met; non-critical gaps
     50 = partially meets qualifications
     25 = missing key qualifications listed as required
      0 = no relevant qualifications / no resume

  soft_skills_match (10 %):
    100 = strong evidence of required soft skills (leadership, comms, collaboration, etc.)
     75 = good signals with minor gaps
     50 = some evidence but limited detail
     25 = little evidence of soft skills
      0 = no signals at all

NO RESUME RULES (if resume section says "NO RESUME"):
  skills_match: 0, experience_match: 0, domain_match: 0,
  qualifications_match: 0, soft_skills_match: 0

CONSISTENCY RULE: identical inputs must produce identical dimension scores.
════════════════════════════════════════

════════════════════════════════════════
INTERCONNECTION RULES — CRITICAL
════════════════════════════════════════
Every section must flow from the evidence above it. These rules are mandatory:

1. gap_reasons → resume_suggestions (one-to-one where possible)
   Each gap_reason that a resume change can address MUST have a corresponding
   resume_suggestion. If the gap is "no Kubernetes experience", the resume_suggestion
   must say "Add Kubernetes to skills section if you have any exposure, even personal
   projects" — not a generic tip. Do not repeat the same gap in both gap_reasons
   and resume_suggestions without the suggestion adding concrete fix guidance.

2. gap_reasons + missing_skills → improvement_plan (explicit mapping)
   Each improvement_plan item must address a specific gap_reason or missing_skill
   identified above. State which gap it closes. Do not generate generic improvement
   advice (e.g. "improve communication skills") unless that gap is explicitly in
   gap_reasons or missing_skills.

3. resume_suggestions vs improvement_plan — complementary, not duplicative
   resume_suggestions = what to change in the resume document right now (wording,
     bullets, sections) to better represent existing experience for THIS role.
   improvement_plan = what real-world skill/experience to acquire over time to
     close actual gaps. Never put the same item in both arrays.

4. resume_strengths → fit_reasons (consistent, not contradictory)
   If you list a strength in resume_strengths, it must also appear as a fit_reason
   or be acknowledged in the verdict. Do not list a strength and then contradict it
   in gap_reasons.

5. All arrays must be non-empty when a resume is present. Minimum:
   resume_strengths: 3, fit_reasons: 3, gap_reasons: 2,
   resume_suggestions: 3, improvement_plan: 3, missing_skills: 2
════════════════════════════════════════

════════════════════════════════════════
INTERVIEW GUIDE — BUILT FROM REAL RESEARCH
════════════════════════════════════════
The COMPANY INTERVIEW RESEARCH section above contains real, searched data about
how {company} interviews. USE IT. Every field in interview_guide must be grounded
in that research. Do not fall back to generic advice when research is available.

If the research says "{company} uses LeetCode hard DSA questions", your technical
questions must reflect that difficulty. If it says "Leadership Principles dominate",
your behavioural section must cover the specific LPs mentioned. If the research
found specific questions candidates reported, include them.

If research returned nothing useful, fall back to inferring from the JD and role type
— but say so in company_style: "No specific interview data found for {company};
the following is based on the JD and typical patterns for this role type."

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (generate 5):
  - Directly tied to skills in the JD, calibrated to the difficulty level found in research
  - Include the WHY (what the interviewer is really testing)
  - Include a step-by-step HOW TO ANSWER framework
  - For coding/DSA: include clarify → brute force → optimise pattern
  - For system design: requirements → capacity → high-level → deep dive

BEHAVIOURAL QUESTIONS (generate 4):
  - Map each to a specific competency the JD requires or that the research flagged
  - If this company uses named frameworks (Leadership Principles, Googleyness, etc.),
    label each question with the framework it tests
  - Provide a detailed STAR guide with SPECIFIC hints for this exact question

COMPANY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS (generate 3):
  - Must be grounded in the research: questions this company is actually known to ask
  - If research found real reported questions, use them
  - Include how to research the company further before the interview

CODING ROUND STRATEGY:
  - Calibrated to THIS company's known coding round format from research
  - Exact steps, what to say when stuck, mistakes to avoid

PREPARATION CHECKLIST (4–6 items):
  - Topics specifically flagged by the research as likely to come up
  - Real resources candidates recommend for this company (from research)
  - Estimated time per topic
